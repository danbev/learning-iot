### ESP8266
Is a microcontroller from Espressif Systems and contains WiFi.

ESP32 is a dual core 160MHz-240MHz CPU where as the ESP8266 is a single core
that runs at 80MHz. Both are 32-bits processors. ESP32 is the successor 

The microcontroller unit on these chips are from Xtensa.

I've got a SparkFun development board ESP8266 Thing.


### Connecting the USB to Serial USB board

```
                                       Serial Basic board
    +--------+                           +----------+
    |(I²C)GND|                         --|GND       |
    |(I²C)3V3|                         --|CTS       |  
    |(I²C)SDA|                         --|VCC  +----+  V
    |(I²C)SCL|--                       --|TX0  |USB |
    |     DTR|--                       --|RX1  +----+
    |     TXO|--                       --|DTR       |  
    |     RX0|--                         +----------+
    |     3V3|--
    |      NC|--
    |     GND|--
    +--------+
GND = Ground (I²C)                       GND = Ground
SDA = Serial Data (I²C)                  CTS = Clear to Send (I²C). Clear To Send (the receiver side is ready)
SCL = Serial Clock (I²C)                 VCC = Voltage Common Collector (I²C) . Power input of the device
DTR = Data Terminal Ready                TX0 = Transmit output
TX0 = Transmit output 0                  RX1 = Recieve input
3V3 = 3.3 Volage                         DTR = Data Terminal Ready (device ready to received/initiate communication)
NC  = Not Connected to anything
```
From the serial basic board the connections look like this:
* Ground which is connected to ground.
* CTS is connected to NC (why?)
* VCC is connected to 3V3 which I think makes sense
* TX0 is connected to RX0
* RX1 is connected to TX0
* DTR is connected to DTR  (I guess this means they are connected)?


### Serial Basic 
This is a USB to serial board similar to FTDI Basic.
Computers used to have RS-232 9-pin or 25-pin serial ports on the back for
connecting to peripherals. In the late 90's USB began to take over and has the
advantage of supplying power to the attached peripheral and more.
An USB to serial bridge is a way to emulate the software interface of a serial
port via standard drivers and allows the user to treat the USB device as though
it were a standard serial port.


### crosstool-NG
This is a cross compiler toolchain I think.


### xtensa
This is the chips are from Xtensa.


### ESP IoT Development Framework (IDF)


### xtensa toolchain
Download and unpack:
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc8_4_0-esp-2020r3-linux-amd64.tar.gz

This contains compilers/assemblers, linkers and tools like, `as`, `gcc`, `g++`
`nm`, `ld`, `objdump` ets. All are specific used for cross compiling. The
can be found in the `bin` directory:
```console
$ ls bin/
xtensa-lx106-elf-addr2line  xtensa-lx106-elf-cpp           xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-ar      xtensa-lx106-elf-gdb      xtensa-lx106-elf-objdump
xtensa-lx106-elf-ar         xtensa-lx106-elf-ct-ng.config  xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-nm      xtensa-lx106-elf-gprof    xtensa-lx106-elf-ranlib
xtensa-lx106-elf-as         xtensa-lx106-elf-elfedit       xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-ranlib  xtensa-lx106-elf-ld       xtensa-lx106-elf-readelf
xtensa-lx106-elf-c++        xtensa-lx106-elf-g++           xtensa-lx106-elf-gcov        xtensa-lx106-elf-ld.bfd   xtensa-lx106-elf-size
xtensa-lx106-elf-cc         xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc           xtensa-lx106-elf-gcov-dump   xtensa-lx106-elf-nm       xtensa-lx106-elf-strings
xtensa-lx106-elf-c++filt    xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-8.4.0     xtensa-lx106-elf-gcov-tool   xtensa-lx106-elf-objcopy  xtensa-lx106-elf-strip
```
So this allows us to compiler and link assembler, C, C++ programs into machine
code that can execute on a xtensa processor

We need to add the this bin directory to our PATH. I've done this in a
setenv.sh file.

### SDK
This is a 
```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK.git
`

```console
$ . ./setenv.sh
```

```console
python -m pip install --user -r $IDF_PATH/requirements.txt
```

### Example project
This section will take a closer look at the example project that is part of the
SDK which can be used as a template.

Start by copying the hello_world example:
```console
$ cp -r $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world .
$ cd hello_world
$ ls 
CMakeLists.txt  main  Makefile  README.md
```
If we take a closer look at the Makefile it simply includes 
.IDF_PATH)/make/project.mk and simlarliy for the CMake file.

There is a `help` target with some details about the targets available.
```console
$ make help
Toolchain path: /home/danielbevenius/work/iot/esp/xtensa-lx106-elf/bin/xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc
Toolchain version: esp-2020r3-49-gd5524c1
Compiler version: 8.4.0
Python requirements from /home/danielbevenius/work/iot/esp/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK/requirements.txt are satisfied.
Welcome to Espressif IDF build system. Some useful make targets:

make menuconfig - Configure IDF project
make defconfig - Set defaults for all new configuration options

make all - Build app, bootloader, partition table
make flash - Flash app, bootloader, partition table to a chip
make clean - Remove all build output
make size - Display the static memory footprint of the app
make size-components, size-files - Finer-grained memory footprints
make size-symbols - Per symbol memory footprint. Requires COMPONENT=<component>
make erase_flash - Erase entire flash contents
make erase_otadata - Erase ota_data partition; First bootable partition (factory or OTAx) will be used on next boot.
                     This assumes this project's partition table is the one flashed on the device.
make monitor - Run idf_monitor tool to monitor serial output from app
make simple_monitor - Monitor serial output on terminal console
make list-components - List all components in the project

make app - Build just the app
make app-flash - Flash just the app
make app-clean - Clean just the app
make print_flash_cmd - Print the arguments for esptool when flash
make check_python_dependencies - Check that the required python packages are installed

See also 'make bootloader', 'make bootloader-flash', 'make bootloader-clean', 
'make partition_table', etc, etc.
```


### Connecting the device
So we need to connect the device and I'm using USB to do this. This will be
discovered by the system and we can get details about this new device in a few
ways. One is to use `dmesg`.

```console
$ dmesg -w
```
`-w` is the follow flag so we should be able to see the new device showing up
in the console:
```console
[696846.518822] usb 1-2: new full-speed USB device number 43 using xhci_hcd
[696846.646023] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1a86, idProduct=7523, bcdDevice= 2.64
[696846.646037] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[696846.646042] usb 1-2: Product: USB Serial
[696846.694744] usbcore: registered new interface driver ch341
[696846.694755] usbserial: USB Serial support registered for ch341-uart
[696846.694772] ch341 1-2:1.0: ch341-uart converter detected
[696846.695431] usb 1-2: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```
Notice that we find the device for this and in this case it is `ttyUSB0`.

```console
$ lsusb
```

```console
$ ls /dev/bus/usb
```
