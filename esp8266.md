### ESP8266
Is a microcontroller from Espressif Systems and contains WiFi.

ESP32 is a dual core 160MHz-240MHz CPU where as the ESP8266 is a single core
that runs at 80MHz. Both are 32-bits processors. ESP32 is the successor 

The microcontroller unit on these chips are from Xtensa.

I've got a SparkFun development board ESP8266 Thing.


### Connecting the USB to Serial USB board

```
                                       Serial Basic board
    +--------+                           +----------+
    |(I²C)GND|                         --|GND       |
    |(I²C)3V3|                         --|CTS       |  
    |(I²C)SDA|                         --|VCC  +----+  V
    |(I²C)SCL|--                       --|TX0  |USB |
    |     DTR|--                       --|RX1  +----+
    |     TXO|--                       --|DTR       |  
    |     RX0|--                         +----------+
    |     3V3|--
    |      NC|--
    |     GND|--
    +--------+
GND = Ground (I²C)                       GND = Ground
SDA = Serial Data (I²C)                  CTS = Clear to Send (I²C). Clear To Send (the receiver side is ready)
SCL = Serial Clock (I²C)                 VCC = Voltage Common Collector (I²C) . Power input of the device
DTR = Data Terminal Ready                TX0 = Transmit output
TX0 = Transmit output 0                  RX1 = Recieve input
3V3 = 3.3 Volage                         DTR = Data Terminal Ready (device ready to received/initiate communication)
NC  = Not Connected to anything
```
From the serial basic board the connections look like this:
* Ground which is connected to ground.
* CTS is connected to NC (why?)
* VCC is connected to 3V3 which I think makes sense
* TX0 is connected to RX0
* RX1 is connected to TX0
* DTR is connected to DTR  (I guess this means they are connected)?


### Serial Basic 
This is a USB to serial board similar to FTDI Basic.
Computers used to have RS-232 9-pin or 25-pin serial ports on the back for
connecting to peripherals. In the late 90's USB began to take over and has the
advantage of supplying power to the attached peripheral and more.
An USB to serial bridge is a way to emulate the software interface of a serial
port via standard drivers and allows the user to treat the USB device as though
it were a standard serial port.


### crosstool-NG
This is a cross compiler toolchain I think.


### xtensa
This is the chips are from Xtensa.


### ESP IoT Development Framework (IDF)


### xtensa toolchain
Download and unpack:
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc8_4_0-esp-2020r3-linux-amd64.tar.gz

This contains compilers/assemblers, linkers and tools like, `as`, `gcc`, `g++`
`nm`, `ld`, `objdump` ets. All are specific used for cross compiling. The
can be found in the `bin` directory:
```console
$ ls bin/
xtensa-lx106-elf-addr2line  xtensa-lx106-elf-cpp           xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-ar      xtensa-lx106-elf-gdb      xtensa-lx106-elf-objdump
xtensa-lx106-elf-ar         xtensa-lx106-elf-ct-ng.config  xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-nm      xtensa-lx106-elf-gprof    xtensa-lx106-elf-ranlib
xtensa-lx106-elf-as         xtensa-lx106-elf-elfedit       xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-ranlib  xtensa-lx106-elf-ld       xtensa-lx106-elf-readelf
xtensa-lx106-elf-c++        xtensa-lx106-elf-g++           xtensa-lx106-elf-gcov        xtensa-lx106-elf-ld.bfd   xtensa-lx106-elf-size
xtensa-lx106-elf-cc         xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc           xtensa-lx106-elf-gcov-dump   xtensa-lx106-elf-nm       xtensa-lx106-elf-strings
xtensa-lx106-elf-c++filt    xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc-8.4.0     xtensa-lx106-elf-gcov-tool   xtensa-lx106-elf-objcopy  xtensa-lx106-elf-strip
```
So this allows us to compiler and link assembler, C, C++ programs into machine
code that can execute on a xtensa processor

### SDK
This is a 
```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK.git
`

```console
$ . ./setenv.sh
```

```console
python -m pip install --user -r $IDF_PATH/requirements.txt
```

### Example project
This section will take a closer look at the example project that is part of the
SDK which can be used as a template.

Start by copying the hello_world example:
```console
$ cp -r $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world .
$ cd hello_world
$ ls 
CMakeLists.txt  main  Makefile  README.md
```
