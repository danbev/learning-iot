### Learning IoT
The sole purpose of this repository is to store notes and code helping me
learn things related to internet of things, but also basic electronics.

### Electrons
An atom is composed of a necleus which consists of a core of tightly bound 
subatomic particles called protons (positive charge) and neutrons (neither 
positive of negative). Rotating around the necleus are electrons. These have orbits
that are referred to rings or shells and an electron has a negative charge.
The number of electrons in orbit equal the number of protons in the necleus and
the atom is electrically balanced.
Electrons can be manipulated, like storing or moving, and be used to produce 
electricity.

### Static electricity
This is where one object has an excess of electrons and the other objects has a 
shortage of electrons. The object with the excess is negatively charge as it now
has more negative electrons that positivly charged protons.
There is an invisible force field called an electric field between two charged
objects. The object with a shortage of electrons attracts the object with the 
excess electrons.
When we have such a situation, where we have two objects with opposite charge
we say there is an electrical potential, or a difference of potential between 
them. This difference is called voltage.
If these two charged objects come to close to one another the electrons jump
the gap between them and create a spark. This is how lightning occurs for example.
The earth is positively charged and the clouds negatively 

### Electricity
This is the flow of electrons. The electrons flowing from one place to another is
called current flow. Voltage, the difference in the charge between to object is
what causes the flow.
Electronics is about controlling the electrons with special components and circuits.


### Electric charge
This is movement of electrons. 

### Voltage
(Spänning in Swedish) is the difference in charge between two points. This is 
measured in volt (V) and the symbol used is `U` from the German word unterschied
that means difference.
Electrons flow from the netative terminal of a voltage source around the curcuit
as they are attracted by the positive terminal.

### Current
Is the rate at which charge is flowing. Is measured in ampere (A) and the symbol
used is `I` which comes from the French word intensite de courant which means
current strength.

### Resistance
Is a materials tendency to resist the flow of charge (current). Is measured in
ohm using the symbol used is capital omega Ω and resistance uses the symbol R.



### Ohm's Law
voltage = Resistance * Current
U = R * I
I = U/R
R = U/I


### Power
Is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an 
electric circuit. The unit of power is watt which is one joule per second.
