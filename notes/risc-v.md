## RISC-V Microcontrollers
As the name hints as RISC-V is a reduced instruction set computer instruction
set architecture (ISA). ISA is perhaps simplified as the design of a computer
in terms of basic operations that it must support. It does not address impl
specific details of the computer so two even if you have 2 processors that
support the same ISA they can be implemented very differently.

### Background
Both ARM and RISC-V are instruction set architectures (ISA) and there are both
reduced instruction set computers (RISC).

ARM licences its arch to companies which have to pay for it. RISC-V is open
source and began its development in 2010 (ARM started in 1990) by Berkely
Parallel Computing Laboratory and later 36 tech companies came together to
form the RISC-V Foundation which was later renamed to RISV-V International in
2020. RISC-V seems to be pronounced as RISC-Five where the 5 comes from this
was Birkely's fifth RISC ISA design.
