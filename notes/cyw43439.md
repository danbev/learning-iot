## CYW43439
Is a single-chip 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11.n radio with integrated Bluetooth
5.2 compatability from Infineon.

This chip is used for example on the Raspberry Pico Pi W (Wirless)
microcontroller board.

Infineon [aquired](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2020/INFXX202004-049.html)
Cypress, who earlier [aquired](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cypress-acquire-broadcoms-wireless-internet-things-business) Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business.
I mention this as when looking for information and reading
source code there can be references to Cypress and often Broadcom.

### Architecture
The CYW43439 is a system of chip (SoC) which has its own CPU (ARM Cortex M3),
RAM/ROM:
```
            +-------------------------------------------+
clock ----→ | ARM Cortex M3         ROM                 |
sdio  ←---→ | RAM                   Wireless interface  |
power ----→ | Power Management      Bluethooth          |
            |                       I/O                 |
            +-------------------------------------------+
```

The processor is ARM Cortex M3 32 bit RISC processor. This processor runs an
embedded operating system named `HNDRTE` which is from Infineon. My
understanding is that the device only contains a minimal boot ROM which will
bring up the device and the host, which is the device that the CYW43349 is
connected/mounted on/to, for example a Raspberry Pico PI W, is responsible for
copying the ARM firmware into the devices memory. More on this later.

If we take the Pico Pi W as an example I think it would communicate with the
CYW43439 using SPI, or SDIO to forward and receive frames. Also control requests
are passed from the host to CYW43439 and it responds with device responses.

The choice of SDIO or SPI is done be setting `SDIO_DATA_2` which is WLAN host
interface select and if this is set to 1 (default) then SDIO is chosen, and if
set to 0 gSPI will be selected.

There is a host driver (DHD) that presents a driver interface. There is a bus
for this communication and there is a control channel and a data channel.
The message format is BDC protocol. TODO: what is this BDC protocol?

The transfers between the host and CYW43439 is message based (framed).
The SDIO bus is an addressable bus and each message must contain an explicit
device target address.

### SDIO
Three functions are supported:
* Function 0, standard SDIO function
* Function 1, backplane function access to the internal System-on-Chip (SoC)
* Function 2, WLAN function for efficient WLAN packet transfer through DMA
* Function 3, BT function for efficient Bluetooth packet transfer through DMA

Function 1 enables access to the internal address space of the device.

### Boot sequence
Upon power up/on, the gSPI host has to wait for 50ms for the device to get out
or reset. This is accomplished by reading from the gSPI register address 0x14
which is function 0 (more on functions later). 

### ioctl (input/output control)
Is a system call for device specific I/O operations. This takes a parameter
specifying the operation/command.

### SDPCM
This is a protocol, and in https://infineon.github.io/wifi-host-driver/html/index.html#overview
we find this:
```
The Bus layer provides bus level protocol handling. For SDIO, a bus protocol
known as SDPCM is used.

SDPCM - SDIO/SPI Bus Layer SDPCM Layer takes care of:
* Adding a Sequence number to packet sent to WLAN Chip
* Flow control between WHD and WLAN Chi
```
So this add credit management, is that what CM stand for perhaps?
SDIO Packet and Credit Management layer?
SDIO Packet Control Management layer?

### Country Locale Matrix (CLM)
This is a database maintained by Cypress and contains regulatory configuration
information like target power outputs of WiFi modules with respect to country,
bands, data rates, and channels.
This blob is loaded dynamically by the Cypress FMAC driver on module activation.

### generic SPI (gSPI)
This is a signaling mode, in addtion to the normal
[signaling modes](./sdio.md#signaling-modes). This provides fixed delays for
responses and data from the device, alignment of host gSPI frames (16 or 32
bits), little/big endian configuration, packet transfer through DMS for WLAN.

This mode can be enabled by setting strapping option SDIO_DATA_2, if this is
1 which is the default which will be SDIO. Pullling this low will enable gSPI.

  +-----------------+                      +----------------------+

DI = Data Input
DO = Data Output
CS = Chip select
```

The gSPI commands are structures of 32-bits:
```
31                                                         0
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 |C|A|F1|F0| Address (17-bits)   | Packet content (11-bits)|
 +---------------------------------------------------------+

C = Command: 0=Read, 1= Write
A = Access: 0=Fixed, 1=Incremental address
F1/F0 = Function number:
          Func 0 (F0) 00=All SPI-specific registers
          Func 1 (F1) 01=Registers and memory beloging to other (backplanei?) block on the device
          Func 2 (F2) 10=DMA channel 1. WLAN packets up to 2048 bytes
          Func 3 (F3) 11=DMS channel 2 (options), like Func 2 up to 2048 bytes
```
In the documentation I was confused with the references to F0, F1, F2, and F3
but I think there are referring to commands with the above SDIO Functions. Like
a command could be a read or write and then the function is specified after that.

Notice that the addresses are only 17-bits. The chip actually uses 32-bit
addresses though. So are some of the addresses inaccessible?  
No, it turns out there is a windowing scheme used to help with the addressing.

So reading from one of the SPI registers would looks something like this I
think:
```
31                                                         0
 +-----------------------------------------------------------+
 |0|0|00|   0x0002               | 0                         |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------+
          0x0002 = Status Enable   Read field/bit 0
```

After a read/write transaction the gSPI interface supports a status notification
to the host which includes info about packet errors, protocol errors, etc. This
will be available in the Data Input wire/line is 32-bits with the following
format:
```
 Bit 0: Data Not Available
 Bit 1: Underflow
 Bit 2: Overflow
 Bit 3: F2 Interrupt
 Bit 4: Reserved?
 Bit 5: F2 RX ready        - F2 FIFO ready to receive data (the FIFO is empty)
 Bit 6: Reserved?
 Bit 7: Reserved
 Bit 8: F2 packet avilable - Packet is available in F2 TX FIFO
```

```

Take the following example example from embassy/cyw43:
```rust
const REG_BUS_CTRL: u32 = 0x0;
...

  self.write32_swapped(REG_BUS_CTRL, 0x00010031).await;
```
If we look at write_32_swapped it does the following:
```rust
    async fn write32_swapped(&mut self, addr: u32, val: u32) {
        let cmd = cmd_word(true, true, FUNC_BUS, addr, 4);

        self.spi
            .transaction(|bus| {
                let bus = unsafe { &mut *bus };
                async {
                    bus.write(&[swap16(cmd), swap16(val)]).await?;
                    Ok(())
                }
            })
            .await
            .unwrap();
    }

fn swap16(x: u32) -> u32 {                                                      
    x.rotate_left(16)                                                           
}

fn cmd_word(write: bool, incr: bool, func: u32, addr: u32, len: u32) -> u32 {   
    (write as u32) << 31 | (incr as u32) << 30 | (func & 0b11) << 28 | (addr & 0x1FFFF) << 11 | (len & 0x7FF)
} 
```
Lets just go though this, we are bacially calling `cmd_word` with the following
arguments:
```rust
  cmd_word(true, true, FUNC_BUS, REG_BUS_CTRL, 0x00010031, 4)
                          0           0

(true as u32) = 1 so that becomes
  (1 << 31)
  100000000000000000000000000000000
And incr is also true so that will become
  (1 << 30)
  010000000000000000000000000000000
| 100000000000000000000000000000000
  110000000000000000000000000000000
After that we have func:
   (0 & 11) << 28
  000000000000000000000000000000000
| 110000000000000000000000000000000
  110000000000000000000000000000000
After that we have addr which is REG_BUS_CTRL which is 0:
   (0 & &1FFFF) << 28
  000000000000000000000000000000000
| 110000000000000000000000000000000
  110000000000000000000000000000000
And finally we have the len which is 4:
  100 & x7FF
  000000000100 & 011111111111 = 000000000000
  000000000000000000000000000000100
| 110000000000000000000000000000000
  110000000000000000000000000000100

So this function will return:
cmd = 110000000000000000000000000000100
0.273836 INFO  cmd: 1001100000000000000

And that will map to the following fields in the command packet:
      C A F1 F0  Address           Packet Length
cmd = 1 1 0  0   00000000000000000 000000000100
```

Now, the value being is `0x00010031` and in binary that is `10000000000110001`.

This is a log running the example in embassy-cyw43:
```console
0.273811 INFO  before setting word_length 32 (little endian)
└─ cyw43::{impl#4}::init::{async_fn#0} @ /home/danielbevenius/work/iot/embassy/cyw43/src/fmt.rs:138
0.273835 INFO  cmd: 11000000000000000000000000000100, swapped: 1001100000000000000
└─ cyw43::{impl#4}::write32_swapped::{async_fn#0} @ /home/danielbevenius/work/iot/embassy/cyw43/src/fmt.rs:138
0.273870 INFO  val: 10000000000110001, swapped: 1100010000000000000001
└─ cyw43::{impl#4}::write32_swapped::{async_fn#0} @ /home/danielbevenius/work/iot/embassy/cyw43/src/fmt.rs:138
```
So if we assume that we are sending these bits using the SPI write protocol and
using 16-bit word operation little endian (which I think might be the default)
then our bytes should be packed like this:
```
  +--+--+--+--+
  |C1|C0|C3|C2|
  +--+--+--+--+

cmd:         11000000000000000000000000000100
rotated(16): 00000000000001001100000000000000

If we split cmd into bytes and rotated the bits we get:

   C3     C2         C1       C0
11000000 00000000 00000000 00000100
   
   C1      C0        C3       C2
00000000 00000100 11000000 00000000
```

We can do the same with the data to be written
```
   D3      D2        D1       D0
00000000 00000001 00000000 00110001

   D1      D0        D3       D2 
00000000 00110001 00000000 00000001
```
When we create the command we specify the `len` which is the packet size to be
written which is 4, which I think is in bytes because the function is named
write32_swapped. Looking at the write procotol it seems to me that the above
will indeed set the `Word Length` to 1 but will also set other values (but they
are all the default values):
```
                                  Status enable (1=default)
   D1      D0        D3       D2  ↓
00000000 00110001 00000000 00000001
           ↑↑  ↑↑                 ↑
           ||  |Word Length (1=32-bit)
           ||  |
           ||  Endianess (0=Little)
           ||
           |High-speed mode (1=High speed (default))
           |
           Interrupt polarity (1=high (default))
```
Could this instead be changes to be a constant like
```rust
const WORD_LENGTH_32: u32 = 0x1;
```
And the the call to `write32_swapped` could be updated to be:
```rust
self.write32_swapped(REG_BUS_CTRL, WORD_LENGTH_32).await;

   D3      D2        D1       D0
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
   D1      D0        D3       D2
00000000 00000001 00000000 00000000
```

### Backplane
Function 1 provides access to the internal System-on-Chip (SoC). If we take a
look at the block diagram of the CYW43439 we can see this backplane.

It is accessed using by using a command structure with `F1F0` being `01`.

This allows access directly to memory addresses. Now, I've been used to being
able to look up addresses for registers in datasheets for different
microcontrollers but I could not find any such information in the datasheet for
[CWY43439](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-CYW43439KUBGT-DataSheet-v03_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7ddc01d7017ddd033d78594d)
and did not understand where these addresses are documented. My current
understanding is that these are not publicly available. I'm sort of guessing
here but I think that an older model was reverse engineered and then others
ported that to new models. Like I said I'm guessing here.

But the following addresses I've found in
[whd_sdio.h](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.15/mbed-os-api-doxy/whd__sdio_8h_source.html)
```c

 #define SBSDIO_ALP_AVAIL_REQ       ( (uint32_t)0x08 )     /* Make ALP ready (power up xtal) */
```
I don't know where these addresses are documented, like I was expecting to find
a datasheet with them. The addresses above were taken from
https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.15/mbed-os-api-doxy/whd__sdio_8h_source.html.

Take the following write call (from Embassy):
```rust
const FUNC_BACKPLANE: u32 = 1;
...
const REG_BACKPLANE_CHIP_CLOCK_CSR: u32 = 0x1000E;

// Init ALP (Active Low Power) clock
self.write8(FUNC_BACKPLANE, REG_BACKPLANE_CHIP_CLOCK_CSR, 0x08).await;
```

### Clocks
* Idle Low Power (ILP)
Generated by either a low-power oscillator (LPO) or by dividing the ALP clock
frequency by a programmable value. Use of this clock maximizes power savings
during idle states.

* Active Low Power (ALP)
Supplied by an internal or external oscillator. This clock is requested by cores
when accessing backplane registers in other cores or when performing minor
computations. When an external crystal is used to provide reference clock, ALP
clock frequency is determined by the frequency of the external oscillator. A
37.4 MHz reference clock is recommended.

* High Throughput (HT)
Supplied by an on-chip PLL. This clock is requested by cores when they transfer
blocks of data to or from memory, perform computation-intensive operations, or
need to meet the requirements of external devices. Cores that cannot tolerate
operations at less than the HT clock frequency, such as the memory controller,
may assert the HT clock request continuously.

### WLAN Software Architecture
The host driver (on the cyw43 device) provides a connection between the host
(in our case the Pico PI W). This is presented as a network driver interface
over a SDIO bus.
